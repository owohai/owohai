## Hey there 👋

I don't think you're supposed to be here 😅

This is the **web** branch (mainly where I keep my portfolio website up). You're welcome to go through the repository but if you're mainly looking to know more about me you might [aswell head on over here](https://github.com/owohai/owohai)

This portfolio was something I quickly whipped up in Figma, which is in fact incomplete (as of 03/06/23)

Take care :)
