## Hey there üëã

I'm owahai. usually go by owa though. Nice to see you!

I'm a hobby developer, and I'm self-taught. While I might not be the best, I've always loved automating anything I do manually

If I had to, I'd consider myself more of a backend developer (don't really like frontend much üò≠) -
I mostly code in Javascript but I do some Python here and there mostly for the great AI tools it has

### A little story about me:

Ever since I joined Discord in 2017, I was fascinated with Discord bots and the idea of developing one ~~at the time I dragged someone to do it for me~~ but afterwards I started learning some Javascript from the [spoon-fed](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/spoon-feed) code I got. From there onwards, I simply kept adding features and commands to my now defunct [Cookie](https://github.com/owohai?tab=repositories#:~:text=Star-,cookie,-Public) discord bot which to this day I still cherish all the knoweldge and expereince I got from it.

Take care :)
